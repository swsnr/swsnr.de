# Javascript moves too fast for me…

We have a few Java libraries and SOAP clients around, based on jaxb, jaxws, and other such relicts. Sometimes we don’t touch these for years, and yet they still run on contemporary JDKs with only moderate difficulties.

We have a .NET/Winforms based desktop application from about 15 years ago, which still runs on contemporary .NET 4 with only marginal changes.

In our Angular app which is but three years old we already went through two major deprecations and migrations which took us two months each, and where we had to touch every single part of the code base.

The older I get the more I learn to appreciate Java.
